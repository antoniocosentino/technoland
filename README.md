## Antonio in the land of Techno ðŸ”ˆ

This is an experiment with React and Spotify Web Api.
The app uses Spotify's API to retrieve real-time playing track and music genres.
By default the information showed is related to my Spotify account.
However you can use it with your Spotify account by using the Connect button.
